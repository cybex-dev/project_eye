Verbosity Levels:
	1: Least Amount of output. Show server start time and critical changes
	4: 1 & Detailed system information, various states & changes occuring
	7: 4 & New clients connecting & disconnecting, ?
	
enum Verbosity {
	Critical = 1,   //fatal, critical, warning, info[1], debug[1]
	Info = 4,       //1, info[4]
	Detail = 7      //4, info[7]

Default verbosity level == 4
default bool debugging = false
